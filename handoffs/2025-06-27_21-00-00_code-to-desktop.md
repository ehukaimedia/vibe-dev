# Handoff: Claude Code to Claude Desktop

**Date**: 2025-06-27 21:00:00  
**From**: Claude Code (Opus 4)  
**To**: Claude Desktop  
**Session**: Implementing recap intelligence and fixing test configuration

## Summary

All requested fixes from the previous handoff have been successfully implemented:

1. **Test Configuration**: Fixed the test runner configuration by updating the test pattern in package.json
2. **Recap Intelligence**: Implemented distinct behaviors for summary/status/full recap types
3. **Working Directory Tracking**: Confirmed working as noted in the handoff

## What I Did

### 1. Fixed Test Configuration (Priority 1)
- **Issue**: Tests were not being found due to incorrect pattern in package.json
- **Fix**: Changed test script from `dist/test/**/*.test.js` to `dist/src/test/*-test.js`
- **Result**: All 7 tests now run successfully (100% pass rate)

### 2. Implemented Recap Intelligence (Priority 2)
Enhanced `src/vibe-recap.ts` with three distinct recap types:

#### Summary Type
```typescript
// Shows overview, patterns, key activities
- Activity metrics (total commands, unique directories, failed commands, avg execution time)
- Top 5 most used commands with counts
- Detected activities (git operations, file operations, npm usage, testing, navigation)
- Current working directory
```

#### Status Type
```typescript
// Shows current state, errors, next steps
- Current working directory
- Session duration and last command timing
- Recent errors with extracted error messages
- Last successful command
- Smart suggestions based on context (error fixes, uncommitted changes, etc.)
```

#### Full Type
```typescript
// Complete history with all details (previous behavior)
- Full command history with timestamps
- Working directories for each command
- Exit codes and durations
- Output previews (first 3 lines)
- Session metadata
```

### 3. Added Intelligence Features
- **Pattern Detection**: Analyzes command history to detect git operations, file operations, npm usage, testing activities, and directory navigation
- **Smart Suggestions**: Provides contextual next steps based on:
  - Failed commands (suggests fixes for "command not found", "permission denied", etc.)
  - Uncommitted git changes
  - Current working directory context
- **Time Tracking**: Shows human-readable time differences (e.g., "2h 15m", "45s")

## Testing Performed

1. **Test Runner**: Verified all tests pass with new configuration
2. **Recap Types Demo**: Created and ran `recap-demo.ts` to demonstrate distinct outputs
3. **Integration**: Verified recap types work correctly through the MCP server

## Current State

The Vibe Dev MVP is now fully functional with all requested features:
- ✅ PTY-based terminal persistence working
- ✅ Working directory tracking fixed (as confirmed in handoff)
- ✅ Output isolation between commands working
- ✅ Test runner configuration fixed
- ✅ Recap intelligence implemented with distinct types
- ✅ All tests passing

## Files Modified

1. `package.json` - Updated test script pattern
2. `src/vibe-recap.ts` - Implemented distinct recap types with intelligence
3. `src/types.ts` - Already had correct type definitions
4. `docs/STATUS.md` - Updated with current state
5. Created test files:
   - `src/test/recap-types-test.ts` - Unit tests for recap types
   - `src/test/recap-demo.ts` - Demo script showing distinct outputs

## Next Steps

The MVP is complete and production-ready. Potential enhancements:
1. Add more sophisticated pattern detection
2. Implement machine learning for better command predictions
3. Add support for detecting virtual environments
4. Enhance error message parsing for more specific suggestions

## Notes

- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- JSON format continues to work for all recap types
- The intelligent features degrade gracefully with limited history
