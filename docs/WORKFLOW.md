# Vibe Dev Workflow

> How we build excellence, one session at a time.

## Session Workflow

Every development session follows this exact pattern:

### 1. Understand Reality (5 minutes)
```bash
cd /Users/ehukaimedia/Desktop/AI-Applications/Node/vibe-dev-mvp
git pull
npm test
cat docs/STATUS.md | grep -A 10 "Active Issues"
```
**Why**: Build on truth, not assumptions.

### 2. Choose Your Impact (2 minutes)
Pick ONE issue from STATUS.md. Total focus.
**Why**: Excellence comes from depth, not breadth.

### 3. Create Task With Purpose
Every task reinforces our vision:

**Performance Task**:
```bash
echo "===== TASK: Make developers wait less ====="
echo "1. Find bottleneck in [FILE:LINE]"
echo "2. Optimize without breaking"
echo "3. Test: time vibe_terminal('echo test')"
echo "4. Success: Feels instant (<1s)"
```

**Intelligence Task**:
```bash
echo "===== TASK: Understand developers better ====="
echo "1. Analyze output pattern in [FILE]"
echo "2. Add intelligence for [WORKFLOW]"
echo "3. Test: vibe_recap shows insight"
echo "4. Success: Suggests next action"
```

### 4. Execute With Excellence (30 minutes)
Write code that proves we're the better choice.

### 5. Prove The Improvement (5 minutes)
```bash
# For performance
echo "BEFORE: 4s response time"
time vibe_terminal("echo test")
echo "AFTER: 0.8s response time"

# For intelligence
echo "BEFORE: Generic output"
vibe_recap({ hours: 1 })
echo "AFTER: Understands Python workflow"
```

### 6. Update Status (2 minutes)
Update STATUS.md with measurable progress.

### 7. Commit With Clarity
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "[type]: [specific improvement]

HANDOFF: Made Vibe Dev better by [MEASUREMENT]
NEXT: [Exact task to continue]"
```

## Task Types

### Performance Tasks
- Reduce response time
- Optimize memory usage
- Improve startup speed
- Streamline execution

### Intelligence Tasks
- Recognize new patterns
- Improve suggestions
- Understand workflows
- Enhance analysis

### Reliability Tasks
- Fix edge cases
- Improve error handling
- Add resilience
- Ensure consistency

## Success Metrics

After EVERY session, you must improve ONE:
1. **Speed**: Response time decreased
2. **Intelligence**: Better workflow understanding
3. **Reliability**: Fewer errors, better handling
4. **Simplicity**: Less code, more capability

## The Only Question

**"After this session, why would a developer choose Vibe Dev?"**

Your answer must be: "Because it's now [faster/smarter/more reliable] than it was this morning."

*Every session ships measurable improvement or it failed.*
