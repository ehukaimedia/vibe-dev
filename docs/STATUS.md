## 🚨 Current Phase: Terminal Tests Need 100% - CRITICAL FOR PC

### ⚠️ Terminal Functionality Must Be 100% (2025-06-28 07:30:00)

**Current State**: 83% overall, but only 60% terminal tests passing
**Critical Issue**: Terminal tests MUST be 100% for Windows/PC compatibility

### 📊 Test Results Breakdown

#### What's Perfect ✅
- ✅ 100% Recap tests (7/7)
- ✅ 100% Integration tests (4/4)  
- ✅ 100% Windows compatibility tests (3/3)

#### What's Failing ❌
- ❌ 60% Terminal tests (6/10) - **MUST BE FIXED**

### 🔍 The 4 Failing Terminal Tests

1. **"should execute commands and return output"**
   - Expected: "Hello World"
   - Got: "" (empty)

2. **"should handle command timeout"**
   - Expected: exit code -1
   - Got: exit code 0

3. **"should clean output properly"**
   - Expected: '"test"'
   - Got: "" (empty)

4. **"should persist state between commands"**
   - Expected: "123"
   - Got: "" (empty)

### 🎯 Root Cause

The `cleanOutput` method in vibe-terminal.ts expects real terminal format but the mock provides a different format. The cleaning logic removes EVERYTHING thinking it's all prompts/echoes.

### 🛠️ Solution Path

Two handoffs created:
1. `/docs/claude-handoffs/2025-06-28_07-15-00_desktop-to-code.md`
2. `/docs/claude-handoffs/2025-06-28_07-25-00_terminal-100-percent.md` (PRIORITY)

The second handoff has specific fixes for each failing test.

### ⚡ Why This Matters

**Terminal at 100% is CRITICAL because:**
- Windows/PC users need reliable terminal functionality
- Core feature of vibe-dev is terminal session management
- Can't confidently test on PC without 100% passing tests
- Production readiness depends on this

### 📈 Progress Update

Even at 83%, this is a massive improvement:
- Before: ALL tests skipped, no validation
- Now: Real tests with mocks, actual validation
- Just need mock output format aligned with cleaning logic

### 🚀 Next Steps

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Fix the 4 terminal tests to reach 100%
2. **THEN**: Test on Windows PC with confidence
3. **FINALLY**: Ship to npm with full platform support
