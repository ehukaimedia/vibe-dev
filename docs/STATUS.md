# Vibe Dev Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-06-27 15:50:00  
**Updated By**: Claude Desktop (Opus 4)

## üéØ Current Phase: Architecture Complete, Ready for MVP Implementation

### ‚úÖ Completed Today

1. **Architecture Design**
   - Decided on PTY (Pseudo-Terminal) approach
   - Analyzed DesktopCommanderMCP implementation
   - Confirmed ~88% code reduction possible
   - Defined clear technical approach

2. **Documentation**
   - Updated README.md with modern, intuitive, reliable messaging
   - Created comprehensive MVP_PLAN.md
   - Established handoff system between Claude Desktop and Claude Code
   - Created vibe-intelligence.ts stub with interfaces

3. **Key Decisions**
   - Use node-pty for terminal emulation
   - Two tools only: vibe_terminal and vibe_recap
   - Focus on prompt detection as critical feature
   - Maintain one persistent PTY session

### üöß Ready for Implementation

1. **Core Terminal (Priority 1)**
   - [ ] Install node-pty
   - [ ] Create VibeTerminal class
   - [ ] Implement prompt detection
   - [ ] Test session persistence
   - [ ] Verify cd/pwd persistence works

2. **MCP Integration (Priority 2)**
   - [ ] Create index.ts server
   - [ ] Implement vibe_terminal tool
   - [ ] Basic vibe_recap tool
   - [ ] Test with Claude Desktop

3. **Intelligence Features (Priority 3)**
   - [ ] Exit code tracking
   - [ ] Command timing
   - [ ] Error detection
   - [ ] Recovery features

### üìä Technical Insights

**From DesktopCommanderMCP Analysis:**
- They use `spawn()` with `shell: true` - no persistence
- Every command runs in isolation
- Complex parsing still breaks on edge cases
- Confirms our PTY approach is superior

**Key Innovation:**
- Traditional: `spawn('cd /project')` - dies immediately
- Vibe Dev: `terminal.write('cd /project\n')` - persists!

### üéØ Next Actions

**For Claude Code:**
1. Read `/docs/production/MVP_PLAN.md` first
2. Start with basic PTY implementation
3. Focus on prompt detection
4. Get session persistence working
5. Build up from simple to complex

### üìù Session Notes

- Extensive discussion on terminal emulation vs command spawning
- Analyzed "Terminal Emulator Mode" document showing code reduction
- Created comprehensive handoff documentation
- Set up communication system between Claude instances

### üöÄ Project Health: Ready for Development

All architecture decisions made. Documentation complete. Ready for Claude Code to implement MVP.
