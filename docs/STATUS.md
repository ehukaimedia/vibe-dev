# Vibe Dev Status

> Updated every session. The living record of our evolution.

## Current Version: 0.1.0 (MVP)

**Last Updated**: 2025-06-27
**Session Type**: Initial Setup
**Focus**: Clean slate preparation

## Implementation Status

### vibe_terminal
- ❌ Basic command execution
- ❌ Session persistence
- ❌ PTY integration
- ❌ Performance optimization (<1s)
- ❌ Cross-platform support

### vibe_recap
- ❌ Command history tracking
- ❌ Pattern recognition
- ❌ Workflow understanding
- ❌ Intelligent suggestions
- ❌ Performance optimization (<500ms)

## Active Issues

### Priority 1: Basic Execution
**Goal**: Get vibe_terminal executing real commands
- Implement PTY wrapper
- Handle stdout/stderr
- Return proper exit codes
- Measure performance

### Priority 2: Session State
**Goal**: Maintain session between calls
- Implement session manager
- Persist working directory
- Maintain environment variables
- Handle session lifecycle

### Priority 3: Intelligence Foundation
**Goal**: Basic pattern recognition in vibe_recap
- Track command history
- Identify common patterns
- Generate simple insights
- Suggest next actions

## Performance Metrics

### Current
- vibe_terminal: Not implemented
- vibe_recap: Not implemented
- Build time: ~2s
- Test suite: ~0.5s

### Targets
- vibe_terminal: <1s response
- vibe_recap: <500ms analysis
- Build time: <5s
- Test suite: <10s

## Recent Sessions

### 2025-06-27 - Initial Setup
- Created MVP structure
- Set up Eight Sacred Documents
- Established clean slate
- **Next**: Implement basic vibe_terminal

## Next Session Plan

### Option A: vibe_terminal Basic Implementation
1. Create PTY wrapper
2. Execute simple commands
3. Capture output correctly
4. Ensure <1s response
5. Add basic tests

### Option B: TDD Setup First
1. Create comprehensive test suite
2. Define performance benchmarks
3. Set up CI/CD pipeline
4. Then implement features

**Recommendation**: Option A - Get basic execution working first

## Learning Log

### What We Know
- Clean structure established
- Documentation complete
- Two tools, clear vision
- Ready for implementation

### What We Need
- PTY implementation knowledge
- Performance optimization techniques
- Pattern recognition algorithms
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Blockers

None currently. Clean slate ready for development.

## The Measure of Success

**Question**: Why would a developer choose Vibe Dev today?
**Answer**: They wouldn't yet - it's not implemented.

**After next session**: "Because it executes commands instantly with session persistence."

*Status: Ready to build excellence.*

## Handoff Notes

For next session:
1. Start with basic vibe_terminal implementation
2. Use node-pty for real terminal emulation
3. Focus on <1s response time from the start
4. Update this STATUS.md with progress
