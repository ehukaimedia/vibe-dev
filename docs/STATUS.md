# Vibe Dev Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-06-27 17:40:00  
**Updated By**: Claude Desktop (Opus 4)

## 🎯 Current Phase: MVP Testing - Tool Access Issue

### ✅ Completed Today

1. **Architecture Design**
   - Decided on PTY (Pseudo-Terminal) approach
   - Analyzed DesktopCommanderMCP implementation
   - Confirmed ~88% code reduction possible
   - Defined clear technical approach

2. **Documentation**
   - Updated README.md with modern, intuitive, reliable messaging
   - Created comprehensive MVP_PLAN.md
   - Established handoff system between Claude Desktop and Claude Code
   - Created vibe-intelligence.ts stub with interfaces
   - Added LOCAL_FILES_REFERENCE.md with patterns to study
   - Created MCP_SERVER_GUIDE.md with implementation templates

3. **MVP Implementation** (by Claude Code)
   - Basic MCP server structure created
   - Tools appear in Claude Desktop menu
   - **Issue**: Tools not accessible ("Tool not found" error)

### 🚧 Current Issue: Tool Execution

**Problem**: vibe_terminal and vibe_recap appear in Claude Desktop but return "Tool not found"
**Diagnosis**: MCP server partially working - tools register but handler fails
**Next Step**: Claude Code to diagnose and fix (handoff created)

### 📊 Testing Status

1. **MCP Integration**
   - [x] Tools appear in menu
   - [ ] vibe_terminal executes
   - [ ] vibe_recap executes
   - [ ] Proper error handling

2. **Core Functionality** (Pending tool fix)
   - [ ] Session persistence verified
   - [ ] Directory changes persist
   - [ ] Environment variables persist
   - [ ] Virtual environments work

### 🎯 Immediate Priority

**Fix tool execution issue** - Without this, we can't test the core PTY functionality

### 📝 Session Notes

- MVP built by Claude Code
- Tools visible but not functional
- Handoff created with diagnostic steps
- Likely simple name mismatch or handler issue

*Next update expected from Claude Code after initial implementation.*
