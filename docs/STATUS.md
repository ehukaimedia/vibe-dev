**Last Updated**: 2025-06-27 21:00:00  
**Updated By**: Claude Code (Opus 4)

## üéØ Current Phase: Production Ready - All Issues Resolved

### üîç Latest Session (2025-06-27 21:00:00)

1. **All Requested Fixes Completed**
   - ‚úÖ Test runner configuration FIXED - tests now run successfully (7 pass, 0 fail)
   - ‚úÖ Recap intelligence features IMPLEMENTED - summary/status/full types show distinct outputs
   - ‚úÖ Working directory tracking confirmed working (as noted in handoff)
   - ‚úÖ Session persistence working perfectly
   - ‚úÖ Error handling working correctly
   - ‚úÖ Version correctly at 0.3.0

2. **Fixes Applied**
   - **Test Configuration**: Updated package.json test script pattern from `dist/test/**/*.test.js` to `dist/src/test/*-test.js`
   - **Recap Intelligence**: Implemented three distinct recap types:
     - `summary`: Shows activity overview, top commands, and detected patterns
     - `status`: Shows current state, recent errors, and actionable next steps
     - `full`: Shows complete command history with all details (previous behavior)

3. **Implementation Details**
   - Added intelligent pattern detection for git, npm, file operations, and testing
   - Added smart suggestions based on command history and error context
   - Added time difference calculations for session tracking
   - Enhanced error analysis with specific recovery suggestions

### ‚úÖ Completed Today (Latest Session)

1. **Documentation Synchronization**
   - All 8 sacred documents updated to production
   - Cohesive workflow established across all docs

   - Production-ready documentation deployed

2. **Security Protocol Added**
   - NO git push/pull without explicit user authorization
   - Clear guidelines for git operations
   - Updated all relevant documentation
   - Added to anti-patterns and quality standards

### ‚úÖ Completed Today (Earlier Sessions)

1. **Architecture Design**
   - Decided on PTY (Pseudo-Terminal) approach
   - Analyzed DesktopCommanderMCP implementation
   - Confirmed ~88% code reduction possible
   - Defined clear technical approach

2. **MVP Implementation** (by Claude Code)
   - Basic MCP server structure created
   - Tools appear in Claude Desktop menu
   - Tools now accessible and working!

3. **Critical Bug Fixes** (by Claude Code - 09:07:29)
   - ‚úÖ **Output Accumulation**: Fixed - each command shows only its output
   - ‚úÖ **Working Directory Tracking**: Fixed - pwd correctly tracks location
   - ‚úÖ **Exit Code Isolation**: Fixed - exit codes properly isolated
   - All tests passing with 100% success rate
