**Focus**: Finalize OS-specific terminal split documentation  
**Baseline**: Production ready with command echo bug identified  
**Result**: Comprehensive documentation for OS-specific implementation  
**Improvement**: Clear architecture plan to fix platform-specific issues  
**Tests**: No changes - 158/162 passing (97.5%)  
**Next Priority**: Mac implements foundation, PC implements Windows version  

**📚 Documentation Created/Updated**:
1. **OS-Split Handoff**: `2025-06-29_21-45-00_desktop-to-code-os-split.md`
   - Complete implementation plan for Claude Code
   - Clear division of labor between Mac and PC
   - Success criteria and testing strategy

2. **Production Plan**: `production/os-specific-terminal-implementation.md`
   - Detailed architecture design
   - Class hierarchy and file structure
   - Migration plan with phases
   - Risk assessment and rollback strategy

3. **TDD Workflow Update**: `TDD-WORKFLOW.md`
   - Added OS-specific test organization
   - Platform test directories (mac/, pc/)
   - PC can now push `src/vibe-terminal-pc.ts`
   - Jest configuration for automatic platform detection

4. **Split Plan**: `production/vibe-terminal-os-split-plan.md`
   - TDD-first approach to splitting
   - Clear explanation that vibe-recap stays unchanged
   - Enhanced permissions for PC development

**🔑 Key Architecture Decisions**:
- Split ONLY vibe-terminal into platform implementations
- vibe-recap remains cross-platform (no changes needed)
- Factory pattern maintains backward compatibility
- PC owns and can push `src/vibe-terminal-pc.ts`

**📁 New Directory Structure**:
```
src/
├── os-detector.ts         # NEW - Platform detection
├── vibe-terminal-base.ts  # NEW - Abstract base
├── vibe-terminal-mac.ts   # NEW - Mac implementation
├── vibe-terminal-pc.ts    # NEW - Windows implementation
├── vibe-terminal.ts       # REFACTOR - Factory pattern
└── vibe-recap.ts         # UNCHANGED - Already cross-platform

test/
├── mac/                  # NEW - Mac-only tests
├── pc/                   # NEW - PC-only tests
└── unit/                 # Existing cross-platform tests
```

**Next Steps**:
1. Mac implements foundation (os-detector, base, mac version)
2. PC pulls foundation and implements Windows version
3. Both verify their platforms work correctly
4. Command echo bug gets fixed in platform-specific file
