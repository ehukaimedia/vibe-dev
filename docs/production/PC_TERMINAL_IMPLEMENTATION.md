# PC Terminal Implementation

## Overview
The PC terminal implementation for vibe-dev has been fully implemented with feature parity to the Mac version. The implementation supports multiple Windows shells and terminal environments.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Shell Detection and Support
- **PowerShell 7** (pwsh.exe) - Primary preference
- **Windows PowerShell** (powershell.exe) - Secondary preference  
- **Command Prompt** (cmd.exe) - Fallback option
- **Git Bash** - Full support including prompt detection
- **WSL** (Windows Subsystem for Linux) - Basic support
- **Cygwin** - Basic support

### 2. Windows Version Detection
- `getWindowsVersion()` - Returns Windows version (e.g., "10.0.22621")
- `getWindowsCodeName()` - Returns friendly name:
  - Windows 11 (build 22000+)
  - Windows 10 with specific version names (22H2, 21H2, etc.)
  - Windows Server 2022/2019/2016
  - Legacy versions (Windows 8.1, 8, 7)

### 3. Terminal Application Detection
- `getTerminalApp()` - Detects:
  - Windows Terminal (via WT_SESSION env var)
  - VS Code integrated terminal
  - PowerShell 7 console
  - Windows PowerShell console
  - Command Prompt
  - Falls back to process inspection if env vars unavailable

### 4. Shell Discovery
- `getAvailableWindowsShells()` - Scans common locations:
  - PowerShell 7 installations
  - Windows PowerShell locations
  - Git Bash installations
  - WSL executable
  - Cygwin installations
  - Also searches PATH for additional shells

### 5. Path Handling
- `expandWindowsPath()` - Comprehensive path expansion:
  - OneDrive path resolution
  - Environment variable expansion (%USERPROFILE%, %APPDATA%, etc.)
  - Tilde (~) expansion to user home
  - UNC path support (\\server\share)
  - Drive letter normalization
  - Path separator normalization

### 6. Enhanced Prompt Detection
- PowerShell prompts (PS C:\...>)
- CMD prompts (C:\...>)
- Git Bash prompts ($ or #)
- WSL prompts (user@host:path$)
- Cygwin prompts
- Custom PowerShell prompts

### 7. Output Cleaning
- Windows line ending conversion (\r\n â†’ \n)
- ANSI escape sequence removal
- PowerShell progress indicator removal
- Command echo removal
- Multi-shell prompt removal
- Special handling for cd/pwd commands

### 8. Additional Features
- `isElevated()` - Detects if running as Administrator
- `getSystemInfo()` - Returns comprehensive system information
- Test method wrappers for unit testing compatibility

## Architecture Notes

The PC implementation extends `VibeTerminalBase` and provides Windows-specific implementations for all abstract methods. It maintains the same API surface as the Mac implementation while handling Windows-specific quirks:

1. **Path Handling**: Windows paths require special handling for drive letters, UNC paths, and different separators
2. **Shell Detection**: Windows has different shell locations and detection methods
3. **Prompt Patterns**: Windows shells have different prompt formats
4. **Process Management**: Uses Windows-specific commands like `wmic` for system information

## Testing Considerations

While I don't have access to a Windows environment for testing, the implementation follows Windows API patterns and shell behaviors. Key areas that should be tested on actual Windows systems:

1. Shell detection across different Windows versions
2. Path normalization with various Windows path formats
3. Prompt detection with custom PowerShell profiles
4. Administrator privilege detection
5. Terminal application detection in different environments

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for future improvement:
1. ConPTY API integration for better terminal emulation
2. Windows Terminal profile detection
3. Enhanced WSL integration
4. PowerShell module detection
5. Support for alternative shells (Nu, Elvish on Windows)
