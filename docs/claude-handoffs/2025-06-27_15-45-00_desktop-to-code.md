# Claude Desktop ‚Üí Claude Code Handoff

**Date**: 2025-06-27_15:45:00  
**From**: Claude Desktop (Opus 4)  
**To**: Claude Code  
**Subject**: Vibe Dev MVP Implementation - Complete Context Transfer

## üéØ Executive Summary

You're building Vibe Dev - a revolutionary MCP server that uses PTY (Pseudo-Terminal) technology to provide true persistent shell sessions. This is NOT another command executor. This is a real terminal with intelligence.

**Core Innovation**: Every command runs in ONE persistent terminal session, just like developers actually work.

## üì¶ What I've Prepared for You

### 1. Documentation (All in `/docs/`)
- `README.md` - Updated with complete vision, shows what we're building
- `production/MVP_PLAN.md` - Your complete implementation guide (READ THIS FIRST!)
- `production/LOCAL_FILES_REFERENCE.md` - Critical local files to study for patterns
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - System design and technical decisions
- `WORKFLOW.md` - How the pieces fit together
- `STATUS.md` - Current state (empty, ready for your updates)

### 2. Source Structure (in `/src/`)
- `index.ts` - MCP server entry point (to be created)
- `vibe-intelligence.ts` - Intelligence engine stub (I created the interfaces)
- `vibe-terminal.ts` - PTY implementation (to be created - YOUR MAIN FOCUS)
- `vibe-recap.ts` - Analysis tool (to be created)

### 3. Key Insights from Today's Analysis

We analyzed DesktopCommanderMCP-Recap extensively:
- They use `spawn()` with `shell: true` - every command is isolated
- No session persistence - `cd /project` is immediately forgotten
- Complex command parsing that still breaks on edge cases
- ~2000 lines of code trying to simulate what a terminal does naturally

**Our Approach**: Use PTY. Let the terminal handle everything. ~200 lines of code.

## üîë Critical Implementation Points

### 1. PTY is EVERYTHING
```typescript
// NOT THIS:
spawn('cd /project', { shell: true })  // Useless - dies immediately

// THIS:
terminal.write('cd /project\n')  // Changes directory in persistent session
```

### 2. Prompt Detection is Critical
The hardest part will be detecting when a command completes. Focus here first:
- Start with simple regex: `/\$\s*$/` or `/#\s*$/`
- Test with bash and zsh
- Add timeout fallback
- This makes or breaks the entire system

### 3. What Success Looks Like
```typescript
// This MUST work:
await vibe_terminal("cd /tmp")
await vibe_terminal("pwd")  // Must output: /tmp

await vibe_terminal("python -m venv myenv")
await vibe_terminal("source myenv/bin/activate")  
await vibe_terminal("pip install requests")  // Must install in myenv!
```

## üöÄ Your Implementation Priority

### Week 1 Focus: Get PTY Working
1. Install `node-pty`
2. Create basic terminal class
3. Implement prompt detection
4. Test with simple commands (ls, cd, pwd, echo)
5. Ensure session persists between commands

### Week 2: MCP Integration
1. Create MCP server structure
2. Implement vibe_terminal tool
3. Basic vibe_recap tool
4. Test with Claude Desktop

### Week 3: Intelligence & Polish
1. Add timing and exit codes
2. Implement recovery features
3. Enhance vibe_recap with intelligence
4. Handle edge cases

## üí° Architecture Decisions Explained

### Why Terminal Emulation?
- **Correctness**: Terminals already handle quotes, pipes, redirects perfectly
- **Compatibility**: If it works in terminal, it works in Vibe Dev
- **Simplicity**: ~90% less code than parsing approach
- **Features**: Tab completion, history, colors - all free

### Why We're Different
Traditional tools see commands.
We see what actually happens.

They guess at intent from command strings.
We know intent from actual outcomes.

## üìä Context from Today's Deep Dive

### 1. We analyzed the "Terminal Emulator Mode" document
- Showed ~88% code reduction possible
- Identified all the complexity that goes away
- Confirmed PTY is the right approach

### 2. We studied DesktopCommanderMCP-Recap source
- Confirmed they use isolated `spawn()` calls
- No session persistence possible with their approach
- Validates our architectural advantage

### 3. We defined clear success metrics
- True session persistence (cd persists!)
- Virtual environments work naturally
- Complex commands work without parsing
- Disconnect recovery preserves everything

## üé≠ The Vibe Dev Difference

**Before** (What others do):
```bash
execute("cd /project")          # Dies
execute("npm install")          # Wrong directory
execute("npm test")             # No context
# Result: Broken workflow
```

**After** (What we do):
```bash
vibe_terminal("cd /project")    # Terminal in /project
vibe_terminal("npm install")    # Installs in /project
vibe_terminal("npm test")       # Tests run in context
# Result: Natural workflow
```

## ‚úÖ Definition of Done for MVP

1. **Core PTY Features**
   - [x] Persistent session across commands
   - [x] Working directory persistence
   - [x] Environment variable persistence
   - [x] Virtual environment support

2. **MCP Integration**
   - [x] vibe_terminal tool works
   - [x] vibe_recap provides basic history
   - [x] Proper error handling

3. **Recovery Features**
   - [x] Sessions survive disconnection
   - [x] Can list active sessions
   - [x] Can show chronological history

## üîß Technical Resources

### Packages You'll Need
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "node-pty": "^1.0.0",
    "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk": "latest"
  }
}
```

### Example PTY Setup
```typescript
import * as pty from 'node-pty';

const shell = process.platform === 'win32' ? 'powershell.exe' : 'bash';
const terminal = pty.spawn(shell, [], {
  name: 'xterm-256color',
  cwd: process.cwd(),
  env: process.env
});
```

## üìù Next Steps

1. **Read `/docs/production/MVP_PLAN.md`** - It has EVERYTHING
2. **Start with basic PTY test** - Just get ls working
3. **Focus on prompt detection** - This is the hard part
4. **Test session persistence** - Make sure cd persists
5. **Build up from there** - Simple to complex

## üéØ Remember

You're not building another command executor.
You're building a real terminal with intelligence.

The magic isn't in parsing commands.
The magic is in understanding what actually happens.

Make it work. Make it simple. Make it revolutionary.
