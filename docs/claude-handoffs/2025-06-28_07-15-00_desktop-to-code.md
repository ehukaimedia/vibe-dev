# Vibe Dev Session Handoff: Fix Remaining Test Failures

## For You (Human Coordinator)

Claude Code successfully implemented Jest testing infrastructure, achieving 87% test pass rate (20/23 tests passing). The remaining 3 failures are all in terminal.test.ts and appear to be mock-related issues where the output cleaning is too aggressive.

### What Was Done:
- ✅ Jest installed with TypeScript support
- ✅ Created comprehensive PTY mocks
- ✅ All tests now run (no more skipping!)
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility achieved

### What Needs Fixing:
3 tests in `src/terminal.test.ts` are failing because the mock PTY returns output with shell prompts and echoed commands, but the cleaning logic removes everything, leaving empty strings.

### Expected Outcome:
- All 23 tests passing
- CI/CD builds successfully on all platforms
- Proper validation of vibe-dev functionality

## For Claude Code - COPY THIS ENTIRE SECTION

```bash
cd /Users/ehukaimedia/Desktop/AI-Applications/Node/vibe-dev
git pull origin main
npm test 2>&1 | grep -A 5 "FAIL"

# Check the current mock implementation
cat src/__mocks__/node-pty.ts | grep -A 20 "write(data"

# Run just the failing tests
npm test -- terminal.test.ts --verbose

# Check how output is cleaned in the actual implementation
grep -n "cleanOutput\|clean" src/vibe-terminal.ts

# Test the specific failing cases
npm test -- -t "should execute commands and return output"
npm test -- -t "should handle command timeout"  
npm test -- -t "should clean output properly"

# After fixing, run all tests
npm test

# Verify CI will work
CI=true npm test

# Check test coverage
npm test -- --coverage --coverageReporters=text
```

## Specific Issues to Fix

### 1. Terminal Test: "should execute commands and return output"
**Problem**: Mock returns `$ echo "Hello World"\nHello World\n$ ` but after cleaning, output is empty
**Solution**: Either:
- Adjust the mock to not include prompts in the output
- OR fix the cleaning logic to preserve the actual output

### 2. Terminal Test: "should handle command timeout"  
**Problem**: Mock doesn't simulate timeout - returns exit code 0 instead of -1
**Solution**: In the mock, for `sleep` commands:
- Don't emit any data
- Don't emit exit event
- Let the terminal timeout logic trigger

### 3. Terminal Test: "should clean output properly"
**Problem**: Same as #1 - output cleaning removes everything
**Solution**: Ensure cleaning logic preserves the actual command output

## Key Mock Issues

The current mock in `src/__mocks__/node-pty.ts`:
```javascript
// Current problematic pattern:
this._emitData(`$ ${trimmedData}\n`);  // Includes prompt
this._emitData(output + '\n$ ');       // Includes trailing prompt
```

This causes the terminal's output cleaning to remove too much. Consider:
1. Don't include prompts in the mock output
2. OR update the cleaning logic to handle mock format
3. Make timeout behavior work by not responding to sleep commands

## Success Criteria
- `npm test` shows all 23 tests passing
- `CI=true npm test` works correctly  
- No TypeScript errors
- Mock behavior matches real terminal closely enough for tests
