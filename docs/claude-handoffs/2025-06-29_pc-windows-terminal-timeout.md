# PC Session Handoff - Windows Terminal Timeout Issue

## Date: 2025-06-29
**From**: PC Developer (Current Session)  
**To**: Next Developer (Windows or Mac)  
**Branch**: `fix/windows-node-pty-blocker`  
**Status**: CRITICAL - Windows terminal not working

---

## üö® Current Issue

**Windows vibe_terminal is completely broken** - times out after 5 seconds with no output.

### Test Results (Just Performed):
```bash
vibe_terminal("echo 'Testing Windows'")
# Result: Timeout after 5001ms
# Exit code: -1
# Output: Empty

vibe_recap({ hours: 0.5, type: "status" })
# Result: Works, but shows the terminal errors
```

## ‚úÖ What Was Accomplished This Session

1. **Verified timeout fix is in place**:
   - Checked `src/vibe-terminal-base.ts` line 150
   - No more `this.ptyProcess?.write('\x03')`
   - Clean timeout handling

2. **Build successful**:
   - `npm run build` completes without errors
   - TypeScript compilation clean

3. **Documentation updated**:
   - STATUS.md updated with Windows verification
   - Date corrected to 2025-06-29

4. **Identified core issue**:
   - Windows terminal times out immediately
   - Suggests PTY process or prompt detection issue

## üîç Debugging Information

### Symptoms:
- Commands timeout after exactly 5 seconds
- No output returned
- Exit code -1 (timeout indicator)
- vibe_recap works (so MCP server is running)

### Likely Causes:
1. **PowerShell not found** - Check if `powershell.exe` is in PATH
2. **Prompt detection failing** - `isAtPrompt()` never returns true
3. **PTY process not starting** - Terminal never initializes
4. **Output cleaning too aggressive** - Removes all output

### Next Debug Steps:
```powershell
# 1. Check PowerShell location
where powershell.exe

# 2. Try absolute path in getDefaultShell()
# Edit vibe-terminal-pc.ts:
# return 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe';

# 3. Add logging to see what's happening
# In vibe-terminal-pc.ts isAtPrompt():
# console.error('Output:', output);
# console.error('Last line:', lastLine);
```

---

## üìù Code to Check

### In `src/vibe-terminal-pc.ts`:

1. **getDefaultShell()**:
   ```typescript
   getDefaultShell(): string {
     return 'powershell.exe'; // Maybe needs full path?
   }
   ```

2. **isAtPrompt()**:
   ```typescript
   protected isAtPrompt(output: string): boolean {
     // Add logging here to see what output looks like
     // The timeout suggests this never returns true
   }
   ```

3. **cleanOutput()**:
   ```typescript
   cleanOutput(rawOutput: string, command: string): string {
     // Make sure this isn't removing everything
   }
   ```

## üéØ Priority for Next Session

**MUST FIX**: Windows terminal timeout issue

This is blocking all Windows functionality. Without this fix:
- Can't run tests
- Can't verify the timeout contamination fix actually works
- Can't use vibe_terminal on Windows at all

---

## üí° Suggested Approach

1. **Start with logging**:
   - Add console.error() in key methods
   - See what output the terminal is producing
   - Check if prompts are being detected

2. **Test minimal case**:
   ```javascript
   const term = new VibeTerminalPC();
   console.log('Created terminal');
   ```

3. **Check Windows-specific issues**:
   - PowerShell execution policy
   - Path separators
   - CRLF vs LF line endings

---

## üìã Files Modified This Session

- `docs/STATUS.md` - Updated with Windows verification (uncommitted)
- Created handoff artifacts

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Regression Risks

- Don't break the timeout fix (no Ctrl+C!)
- Don't break Mac functionality
- Test every change carefully
- Keep changes minimal and focused

---

**Remember**: The timeout contamination fix is verified in the code. Now we need to get Windows terminal actually working to prove it functions correctly!
