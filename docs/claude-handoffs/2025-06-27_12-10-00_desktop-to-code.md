# Vibe Dev Session Handoff

## For You (Human Coordinator)

### Current State
I've completed production readiness verification testing and found **critical issues** that prevent the tools from being production ready. While basic functionality works well, there's a terminal hanging bug that makes the system unusable after any command timeout.

### Critical Issue Found
**Terminal Hang on Timeout**: When any command times out (default 3 seconds), the entire vibe_terminal session becomes permanently unresponsive. All subsequent commands fail with exit code -1 and timeout after 3 seconds.

### What Needs Fixing
1. **Primary Issue**: Fix the timeout handling in the terminal implementation so sessions remain usable after a timeout
2. **Secondary Issue**: Investigate why for loops don't produce output
3. **Test Suite**: Ensure npm test can complete without hanging the terminal

### Expected Outcome
After fixes:
- Commands that timeout should fail gracefully without affecting the session
- The terminal should remain responsive after timeouts
- Full test suite should complete successfully
- For loops should show their iteration output

## For Claude Code - COPY THIS ENTIRE SECTION
```bash
cd /Users/ehukaimedia/Desktop/AI-Applications/Node/vibe-dev
git status
git log --oneline -5

# Reproduce the critical timeout bug
echo "Testing basic command before timeout"
sleep 4
echo "This command will fail if bug exists"

# Check current timeout handling implementation
grep -n "timeout" src/tools/terminal.ts
grep -n "kill\|terminate" src/tools/terminal.ts
grep -n "cleanup" src/tools/terminal.ts

# Check PTY handling
grep -n "pty\|PTY" src/tools/terminal.ts
cat src/tools/terminal.ts | grep -A 10 -B 10 "onData"

# Run edge case tests individually to debug
cd /Users/ehukaimedia/Desktop/AI-Applications/Node/vibe-dev
npm run build
node dist/src/test/edge-cases-test.js

# After fixing, verify the fix works
echo "Testing basic command before timeout"
sleep 4
echo "This should work after fix"
pwd
ls -la

# Run full test suite after fixes
npm test
```
