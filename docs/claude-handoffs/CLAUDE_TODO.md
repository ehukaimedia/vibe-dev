# Claude's TODO List - Vibe Dev

**Last Updated**: June 30, 2025  
**Status**: Mac  Production Ready | Windows = Awaiting Validation

## =¨ Immediate Priority (Next Session)

### 1. Review Gemini CLI's Windows Test Results
- [ ] Read GEMINI_REPORTS.md for Windows validation results
- [ ] Identify any timeout issues or failures
- [ ] Analyze performance metrics vs targets
- [ ] Check exit code accuracy
- [ ] Review output quality feedback

### 2. Address Windows Issues (If Any)
- [ ] Fix any remaining timeout problems
- [ ] Optimize PowerShell banner removal if needed
- [ ] Enhance prompt detection for edge cases
- [ ] Improve CMD.exe support if issues found
- [ ] Performance tune if >2s execution times

### 3. Regression Testing
- [ ] Run full test suite before any changes
- [ ] Verify Mac functionality remains intact
- [ ] Ensure no performance degradation
- [ ] Check all platforms after fixes

## =Ë Short-Term Tasks (This Week)

### 1. Complete Unit Test Suite
As per TDD-WORKFLOW.md, implement:
- [ ] `test/unit/platform-detection.test.js`
- [ ] `test/unit/shell-detection.test.js`
- [ ] `test/unit/output-parser.test.js`
- [ ] `test/unit/exit-code-extraction.test.js`

### 2. Integration Test Expansion
- [ ] `test/integration/mac/basic-commands.test.js`
- [ ] `test/integration/mac/session-persistence.test.js`
- [ ] `test/integration/mac/shell-compatibility.test.js`
- [ ] `test/integration/windows/basic-commands.test.js`
- [ ] `test/integration/windows/powershell.test.js`
- [ ] `test/integration/windows/cmd-support.test.js`

### 3. Cross-Platform Tests
- [ ] `test/integration/cross-platform/recap-functionality.test.js`
- [ ] `test/integration/cross-platform/error-handling.test.js`

### 4. Performance Benchmarks
- [ ] Create automated performance regression tests
- [ ] Set up CI/CD performance monitoring
- [ ] Document performance baselines
- [ ] Add performance gates to test suite

## <¯ Medium-Term Goals (Next Month)

### 1. Extended Shell Support
- [ ] Test with fish shell on Mac
- [ ] Test with PowerShell Core on Windows
- [ ] Add WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) support
- [ ] Test with custom prompts (Starship, Oh My Zsh, etc.)

### 2. Enhanced Error Recovery
- [ ] Implement graceful timeout recovery
- [ ] Add retry logic for transient failures
- [ ] Better error messages for users
- [ ] Fallback strategies for PTY failures

### 3. Advanced Features
- [ ] Implement marker-based completion detection (Gemini's suggestion)
- [ ] Add support for long-running commands
- [ ] Implement command cancellation
- [ ] Add progress indicators for slow operations

### 4. Documentation Enhancement
- [ ] Create user guide with examples
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Document shell configuration tips
- [ ] Create video tutorials

## =€ Long-Term Vision (Next Quarter)

### 1. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement command result caching
- [ ] Add predictive command completion
- [ ] Optimize memory usage for long sessions
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for large outputs

### 2. Platform Expansion
- [ ] Linux support (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora)
- [ ] Docker container support
- [ ] Remote SSH session support
- [ ] Cloud shell integration

### 3. AI Enhancement
- [ ] Smarter command parsing
- [ ] Intelligent error correction
- [ ] Context-aware suggestions
- [ ] Learning from user patterns

### 4. Enterprise Features
- [ ] Audit logging
- [ ] Security hardening
- [ ] Multi-user support
- [ ] Policy enforcement

## =Ý Notes

### Priority Order:
1. **Critical**: Windows validation results and fixes
2. **High**: Unit test implementation
3. **Medium**: Integration test expansion
4. **Low**: Long-term features

### Success Metrics:
- Windows tests passing at >95% rate
- All platforms <2s execution time
- Zero regressions in Mac functionality
- 90%+ test coverage achieved

### Dependencies:
- Waiting for Gemini CLI's Windows test results
- Need user feedback on Windows improvements
- Performance baselines need establishing
