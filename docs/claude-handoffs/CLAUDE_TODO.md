# Claude's TODO List - Vibe Dev

**Last Updated**: June 30, 2025 (Evening Session)  
**Status**: Mac = Production Ready ✅ | Windows = Critical Fixes In Progress 🔧

## 🚨 Immediate Priority (Next Session)

### 1. Fix Windows PATH Environment Issues 🔴
- [ ] Investigate why PATH is not inherited in PowerShell sessions
- [ ] Test with different shell initialization options
- [ ] Ensure git, npm, node are accessible in Windows sessions
- [ ] Add environment variable inheritance verification
- [ ] Consider explicit PATH passing in PTY options

### 2. Complete Windows-Specific Parser Tests
- [ ] Create comprehensive Windows output parser unit tests
- [ ] Test PowerShell prompt detection edge cases
- [ ] Test CMD prompt variations
- [ ] Test error message parsing
- [ ] Test multi-line output handling

### 3. Windows Integration Testing
- [ ] Create Windows integration test suite
- [ ] Test with real PowerShell commands
- [ ] Test with CMD commands
- [ ] Verify exit code accuracy
- [ ] Test session persistence

## 🔧 Remaining Critical Windows Issues

### PATH Environment Not Available
- **Problem**: Standard tools (git, npm, node) not found in Windows sessions
- **Impact**: Developers cannot use normal workflow
- **Root Cause**: PowerShell session not inheriting system PATH
- **Priority**: HIGH - Blocks basic functionality
- **Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

### Enhanced Prompt Detection Needed
- **Problem**: Windows prompts have more variations than anticipated
- **Solution**: Implement dynamic prompt learning per Gemini's recommendation
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Estimated Time**: 2 hours

### Telemetry and Debugging
- **Need**: Better logging for diagnosing Windows-specific issues
- **Solution**: Add startup telemetry as recommended by Gemini
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Estimated Time**: 1 hour

## ✅ Completed Tasks (This Session - June 30 Evening)

### Windows Critical Fixes Completed ✅
- [x] Fixed parser to properly strip VIBE_EXIT_CODE patterns
- [x] Improved exit code removal logic (handles same-line output)
- [x] Made node-pty mandatory dependency (no more child_process fallback)
- [x] Added startup validation for node-pty availability
- [x] Enhanced error messages for missing dependencies

### Parser Improvements ✅
- [x] Added removeExitCodePatterns method for early cleanup
- [x] Fixed command detection to handle wrapped commands
- [x] Improved handling of PowerShell Write-Host patterns
- [x] Better CMD echo ERRORLEVEL handling
- [x] Created Windows parser test suite (4/5 tests passing)

### Dependency Management ✅
- [x] Moved node-pty from optionalDependencies to dependencies
- [x] Added clear error messages with installation instructions
- [x] Added Windows version checking for ConPTY support
- [x] Removed fallback to inferior child_process implementation

## 📋 Short-Term Tasks (This Week)

### 1. Complete Unit Test Suite
As per TDD-WORKFLOW.md, implement:
- [ ] `test/unit/platform-detection.test.js`
- [ ] `test/unit/shell-detection.test.js`
- [ ] `test/unit/output-parser.test.js` (Windows-specific tests)
- [ ] `test/unit/exit-code-extraction.test.js`

### 2. Integration Test Expansion
- [ ] `test/integration/windows/basic-commands.test.js`
- [ ] `test/integration/windows/powershell.test.js`
- [ ] `test/integration/windows/cmd-support.test.js`
- [ ] `test/integration/windows/path-environment.test.js`

### 3. Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update README.md with Windows fixes
- [ ] Document node-pty installation requirements
- [ ] Add Windows troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md with fixes

## 🎯 Medium-Term Goals (Next Month)

### 1. Extended Shell Support
- [ ] Test with fish shell on Mac
- [ ] Test with PowerShell Core on Windows
- [ ] Add WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) support
- [ ] Test with custom prompts (Starship, Oh My Zsh, etc.)

### 2. Enhanced Error Recovery
- [ ] Implement graceful timeout recovery
- [ ] Add retry logic for transient failures
- [ ] Better error messages for users
- [ ] Fallback strategies for PTY failures

### 3. Advanced Features
- [ ] Implement marker-based completion detection (Gemini's suggestion)
- [ ] Add support for long-running commands
- [ ] Implement command cancellation
- [ ] Add progress indicators for slow operations

## 📊 Progress Summary

### Mac Platform: 100% Complete ✅
- All features working perfectly
- Performance exceeds targets (<20ms)
- Clean output without artifacts
- Production deployed and stable

### Windows Platform: 60% Complete 🔧
- **Fixed Today**: Parser issues, exit code detection, dependency management
- **Remaining**: PATH inheritance, integration tests, prompt variations
- **Estimated Completion**: 6-9 hours of focused work

### Overall Project: 80% Complete
- Core functionality stable on Mac
- Windows fixes progressing well
- Architecture proven sound
- Ready for production on Mac, Windows needs final push

## 📝 Notes

### Priority Order:
1. **Critical**: Windows PATH environment fix (blocks all development)
2. **High**: Windows integration tests
3. **Medium**: Enhanced prompt detection
4. **Low**: Long-term features

### Success Metrics:
- Windows tests passing at >95% rate
- All platforms <2s execution time
- Zero regressions in Mac functionality
- 90%+ test coverage achieved

### Key Insights from Today:
- Parser fix resolved VIBE_EXIT_CODE visibility issue
- node-pty mandatory prevents fallback issues
- Windows PATH problem is the main remaining blocker
- Architecture is sound, just needs Windows-specific tuning
