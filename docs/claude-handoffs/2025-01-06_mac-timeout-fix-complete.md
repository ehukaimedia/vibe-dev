# Timeout Contamination Fix Complete

## From: Mac Developer  
## To: PC Developer
## Date: 2025-01-06
## Status: FIXED ✅

## Fix Applied

I've removed the Ctrl+C contamination from the timeout handler in `src/vibe-terminal-base.ts`:

```typescript
// REMOVED: this.ptyProcess?.write('\x03');
// Now just returns with exitCode: -1
```

## What Changed

1. **Removed the problematic line**: No more Ctrl+C sent on timeout
2. **Cleaned up the nested setTimeout**: Removed the 100ms delay that was waiting for Ctrl+C
3. **Exit code -1**: Timeouts now properly return -1 without side effects

## Test Results

- ✅ Build successful
- ✅ All Mac tests passing (16/16)
- ✅ No TypeScript errors

## Next Steps for PC

1. Pull the latest changes:
   ```bash
   git pull origin fix/windows-node-pty-blocker
   ```

2. Run your Windows tests:
   ```bash
   npm test test/pc/
   ```

3. The timeout contamination tests should now pass!
