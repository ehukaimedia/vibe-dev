# Vibe Dev GitHub Actions Test Fixes

## For You (Human Coordinator)

We've set up GitHub Actions CI/CD for cross-platform testing. The initial run failed due to test file naming issues, which have been fixed. Now we need Claude Code to:

1. Monitor the current test run
2. Fix any failing tests
3. Ensure all platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux) pass

## Current Status
- GitHub Actions workflow created and running
- Test file naming fixed (renamed to *-test.ts pattern)
- Tests are now executing on all platforms
- Need to fix any platform-specific failures

## For Claude Code - COPY THIS ENTIRE SECTION

```bash
cd /Users/ehukaimedia/Desktop/AI-Applications/Node/vibe-dev

# Check current test status
gh run list --repo ehukaimedia/vibe-dev --limit 3

# Build and run tests locally
npm run build
npm test

# If tests fail, check specific test files
ls -la src/test/*-test.ts

# Run individual test files to isolate issues
node dist/src/test/windows-compatibility-test.js
node dist/src/test/timeout-fix-test.js
node dist/src/test/for-loop-test.js

# Check for Windows-specific issues
grep -r "process.platform" src/
grep -r "win32" src/

# View failed GitHub Actions logs
gh run view --repo ehukaimedia/vibe-dev --log-failed

# After fixing issues
git add -A
git commit -m "Fix [describe what was fixed]"
git push origin main
```

## Known Issues to Check

1. **Windows Path Handling**: Backslashes vs forward slashes
2. **PowerShell vs Bash**: Different command syntax
3. **Environment Variables**: $VAR vs %VAR% vs $env:VAR
4. **Line Endings**: CRLF vs LF
5. **Timeout Handling**: Platform-specific timeout commands

## Expected Outcomes
- All 9 GitHub Actions jobs pass (3 OS Ã— 3 Node versions)
- Windows-specific tests work correctly
- No platform-specific failures
