# Vibe Dev Session Handoff

**Date**: 2025-06-28_10-15-00  
**From**: Claude Desktop  
**To**: Claude Code  
**Status**: üîç Issue Identified & Tested

## For You (Human Coordinator)

**Issue**: Working Directory Tracking in Recap
**Impact**: Recap shows incorrect working directory in command history
**Priority**: Medium - affects user understanding but not functionality

## Issue Details

**Current Behavior**:
- Commands execute in the correct directory (verified)
- BUT recap shows wrong working directory in history
- Example: After `cd /Users/.../vibe-dev`, recap still shows `workingDirectory: "/tmp"`

**Expected Behavior**:
- Recap should show the actual working directory where each command executed
- Working directory should update after `cd` commands

**Root Cause Hypothesis**:
The vibe-recap tool is not properly tracking pwd changes in the session. The terminal executes correctly but the tracking/reporting is broken.

## Testing Evidence

```json
// From recap JSON after cd /Users/.../vibe-dev:
{
  "command": "git status",
  "workingDirectory": "/tmp",  // WRONG - should be /Users/.../vibe-dev
  "exitCode": 0,
  "output": "On branch main..."  // But git status worked, proving we ARE in vibe-dev
}
```

## For Claude Code - COPY THIS ENTIRE SECTION

```bash
cd /Users/ehukaimedia/Desktop/AI-Applications/Node/vibe-dev
git status
npm test

# Reproduce the issue
npm run build

# Test sequence showing the bug:
vibe_terminal "cd /tmp"
vibe_terminal "pwd"  # Shows: /tmp (correct)
vibe_terminal "cd /Users/ehukaimedia/Desktop/AI-Applications/Node/vibe-dev"
vibe_terminal "pwd"  # Shows: /Users/.../vibe-dev (correct)
vibe_recap --format json --hours 1  # Check workingDirectory fields

# Bug: workingDirectory in recap doesn't update after cd commands

# After fixing, verify:
# 1. Each command in recap shows correct workingDirectory
# 2. workingDirectory updates after cd commands
# 3. Test with multiple directory changes

# Also fix:
# Update package.json version to 0.3.0 to match CHANGELOG.md
```

## Secondary Issues to Address

1. **Version Mismatch**:
   - package.json shows 0.1.0
   - CHANGELOG.md shows 0.3.0 as production ready
   - Update package.json to 0.3.0

2. **Test Runner Pattern** (if time permits):
   - npm test finds 0 tests despite tests existing
   - May need to adjust test file pattern

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ Recap shows correct working directory for each command
‚úÖ Working directory updates properly after cd commands
‚úÖ package.json version matches CHANGELOG (0.3.0)

## DO NOT Execute

```bash
# After all fixes and tests pass:
git add -A
git commit -m "fix: working directory tracking in recap tool"
git status

# DO NOT RUN - Request authorization:
# git push origin main
```
