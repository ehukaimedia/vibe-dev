# TypeScript Test Fixes - Vibe Dev

## For You (Claude Desktop)
- Initial issue: 4 test suites had TypeScript errors preventing them from running
- Current status: Tests are now running but some are failing due to mock issues
- Main problems fixed: Missing `format` parameter and mock typing issues
- Remaining work: Some tests still failing due to mock implementation challenges

## Test Status After Fixes

### Fixed Issues:
1. ✅ **recap-coverage.test.ts** - Added missing `format` parameter to all `generateRecap` calls
2. ✅ **index.test.ts** - Fixed console.error mock to include empty function
3. ✅ **server.test.ts** - Converted to manual mocks to avoid typing issues
4. ✅ **vibe-terminal-coverage.test.ts** - Fixed mock typing and removed non-null assertions

### Current Test Results:
- Test Suites: 17 failed, 6 passed, 23 total
- Tests: 73 failed, 87 passed, 160 total
- Tests are now running (previously couldn't run due to TypeScript errors)

### Remaining TypeScript Issues:
- 9 TypeScript errors remain, mostly in:
  - test/fixtures/performance-baseline.ts (index signature issue)
  - test/unit/server.test.ts (mock typing issues with 'never' type)
  - test/unit/vibe-terminal-coverage.test.ts (callable expression issue)

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Fixed generateRecap Format Parameter
All calls to `generateRecap` now include the required `format: 'text'` parameter:
```typescript
// Before
const recap = await generateRecap({ hours: 1, type: 'full' });

// After
const recap = await generateRecap({ hours: 1, type: 'full', format: 'text' });
```

### 2. Fixed Mock Implementations
Converted to manual mocks to avoid Jest typing issues:
```typescript
// Create manual mocks
const mockGetTerminal = jest.fn();
const mockExecuteTerminalCommand = jest.fn();

// Mock the module
jest.mock('../../src/vibe-terminal.js', () => ({
  getTerminal: mockGetTerminal,
  executeTerminalCommand: mockExecuteTerminalCommand
}));
```

### 3. Fixed Async Test Functions
Added `async` to test functions that were missing it:
```typescript
// Before
it('should format long duration in hours', () => {

// After  
it('should format long duration in hours', async () => {
```

## Next Steps for Claude Desktop

1. **Mock Implementation Issues**: Many tests are failing because mocks aren't intercepting the real implementations. The real terminal is being created in tests that should be mocked.

2. **Test Isolation**: Tests need better isolation - some are creating real terminal sessions which causes:
   - Jest not exiting cleanly
   - Tests timing out
   - Actual terminals being spawned during test runs

3. **Suggestions for Next Session**:
   - Consider using `jest.doMock()` for dynamic mocking
   - Look into why jest.mock() isn't preventing real module imports
   - May need to restructure how modules are imported in tests
   - Consider adding `--detectOpenHandles` to Jest to find what's keeping it open

4. **Coverage Goal**: With tests now running, you can work towards the 100% coverage goal by fixing the failing tests and adding missing test cases.

## Commands to Run
```bash
# Check current test status
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Check TypeScript errors
npx tsc --noEmit

# Run specific test file
npm test test/unit/recap-coverage.test.ts
```

The foundation is fixed - tests are running again. Now it's a matter of fixing the mock implementations to get them passing!
