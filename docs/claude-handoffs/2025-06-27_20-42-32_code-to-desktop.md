# Vibe Dev Session Handoff - Mac Development Complete

## For You (Human Coordinator)

### Context
Successfully completed Mac development session. The project was already in good state on Mac:
- All tests passing (21/23, 2 skipped)
- Build completes successfully
- Server starts without errors
- Using standard `node-pty` package (not @lydell/node-pty)

### Current Status
1. **Tests**: All 21 tests passing (2 skipped in CI)
2. **Build**: TypeScript compilation successful
3. **Server**: MCP server starts and runs correctly
4. **Imports**: Using standard 'node-pty' on Mac (no changes needed)

### Key Findings
- The import issues mentioned in the handoff were Windows-specific
- Mac environment works fine with standard `node-pty` package
- No changes were required to imports or mocks
- Project is ready for continued development

### Next Steps
- If returning to Windows development, may need to switch to @lydell/node-pty
- Consider creating platform-specific configurations for Windows vs Mac/Linux
- Current setup is optimal for Mac/Linux development
