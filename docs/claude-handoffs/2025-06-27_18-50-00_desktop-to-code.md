# Vibe Dev Session Handoff

**Date**: 2025-06-27_18:50:00  
**From**: Claude Desktop (Opus 4)  
**To**: Claude Code  
**Issue**: Output accumulation and working directory tracking issues

## For You (Human Coordinator)

### Current Situation
The MVP tools are working and accessible! However, testing revealed three critical issues:

1. **Output Accumulation**: Commands are showing cumulative output from all previous commands
2. **Working Directory Tracking**: All commands show `workingDirectory: "/"` even after `cd` commands
3. **Exit Code Propagation**: Failed commands are retroactively applying their exit codes to previous commands

### Test Results
- ✅ Tool Access: Both vibe_terminal and vibe_recap are working
- ✅ Session Persistence: Environment variables and directory changes persist
- ❌ Output Isolation: Each command shows all previous outputs
- ❌ Directory Tracking: Metadata doesn't update after `cd`
- ❌ Exit Code Tracking: Exit codes bleeding across commands

### Root Cause Analysis
- The `commandOutput` variable accumulates data for the current command
- The `this.output` maintains full session history
- When storing to history, we're storing the wrong output (session history instead of command output)
- Working directory extraction works but the stored value isn't updating

### Expected Fix
After your fixes:
- Each command in recap should show ONLY its own output
- Working directory should update correctly after `cd` commands
- Exit codes should be isolated to their respective commands

### Your Next Steps
1. Copy the ENTIRE "For Claude Code" section below
2. Fix the output isolation issue in vibe-terminal.ts
3. Fix the working directory tracking
4. Test thoroughly with the edge cases script
5. Create your handoff when complete

## For Claude Code - COPY THIS ENTIRE SECTION

```bash
cd /Users/ehukaimedia/Desktop/AI-Applications/Node/vibe-dev

# Check current implementation
grep -n "commandOutput" src/vibe-terminal.ts
grep -n "this.output" src/vibe-terminal.ts
grep -n "workingDirectory" src/vibe-terminal.ts

# Look at the history storage
grep -A5 -B5 "commandHistory.push" src/vibe-terminal.ts

# The issue: we're storing the wrong output
# Line ~106: output: result.output (this is cleaned correctly)
# But commands are accumulating previous outputs

# Test current behavior
npm run build
node dist/index.js

# In another terminal:
cd /tmp
echo "Test command 1"
echo "Test command 2"
pwd

# Check the recap - you'll see accumulated output

# Fix needed in vibe-terminal.ts:
# 1. Ensure commandOutput is reset per command (it is)
# 2. Store only the cleaned command output in history
# 3. Update currentWorkingDirectory when cd is detected
# 4. Ensure exit codes are per-command

# After fixing, run the edge cases tests
npm test

# Verify fixes work
node dist/index.js
# Test with multiple commands and check recap
