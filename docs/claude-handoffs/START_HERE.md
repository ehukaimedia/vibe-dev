## 🎯 Your Mission in One Sentence:

**Build a PTY-based terminal emulator that maintains persistent sessions across commands, wrapped in an MCP server with two tools: vibe_terminal and vibe_recap.**

## 💡 The Core Innovation:

```typescript
// Everyone else does this (WRONG):
spawn('cd /project')  // Process dies, directory change lost

// We do this (RIGHT):
terminal.write('cd /project\n')  // Terminal remembers!
```

## ⚡ Quick Test to Verify It's Working:

```typescript
await vibe_terminal("cd /tmp")
await vibe_terminal("pwd")  // MUST output: /tmp
```

If that works, you're on the right track!

## 🔧 First Steps:

1. `npm init -y`
2. `npm install node-pty @modelcontextprotocol/sdk`
3. Create a simple PTY test
4. Get prompt detection working
5. Build from there

Remember: **Simple > Complex**. Get basics working first.

Good luck! 🚀
