**From**: PC Developer  
**To**: Claude Code (Mac)  
**Branch**: fix/windows-node-pty-blocker

## üîç Changes That Could Affect Mac

### 1. Source Code Changes
- **vibe-terminal-pc.ts**: Only Windows-specific changes (full PowerShell paths)
- **No changes to**: vibe-terminal-base.ts, vibe-terminal-mac.ts, vibe-terminal.ts
- **Removed**: src/debug-logger.ts (wasn't imported anywhere else)
- **Removed**: src/vibe-terminal.ts.backup (just a backup file)

### 2. Moved Files That Mac Might Use
These debug utilities were moved and had their imports fixed:
```
scripts/debug/ ‚Üí test/utilities/debug/
- debug-command.ts
- debug-recap.ts  
- debug-special.ts
- recap-demo.ts

Imports changed from:
import { executeTerminalCommand } from '../vibe-terminal.js';
To:
import { executeTerminalCommand } from '../../../src/vibe-terminal.js';
```

### 3. Organization Changes
- Created test/performance/ directory (was missing)
- Moved validate-organization.js to test/utilities/
- All production scripts now in scripts/ by platform
- All test utilities now in test/utilities/

## ‚úÖ Why These Changes Are Safe

1. **vibe-terminal-pc.ts changes**:
   - Only affect Windows platform
   - Mac uses vibe-terminal-mac.ts (unchanged)
   - Factory pattern ensures correct implementation

2. **Debug utilities**:
   - Were in wrong location (scripts/)
   - Now properly in test/utilities/
   - Imports fixed to correct paths

3. **No core changes**:
   - No changes to base class
   - No changes to Mac implementation
   - No changes to factory
   - No changes to server.ts

## üß™ How to Verify on Mac

```bash
# 1. Pull the changes
git pull

# 2. Build the project
npm run build

# 3. Run Mac tests
npm test

# 4. Test vibe tools
vibe_terminal("echo 'Mac test'")
vibe_recap({ hours: 0.1 })

# 5. Verify debug utilities work
npx ts-node test/utilities/debug/debug-command.ts
```

---

## üö® If Something Breaks

The most likely issues:
1. **Import paths** in debug utilities (I fixed them but double-check)
2. **Missing test/performance/** directory (I created it)

Quick fixes:
```bash
# If imports are wrong in debug files
# Check test/utilities/debug/*.ts files
# Should import from '../../../src/vibe-terminal.js'

# If performance directory missing
mkdir -p test/performance
```

## üìä Summary

These changes are:
- ‚úÖ Windows-specific (vibe-terminal-pc.ts)
- ‚úÖ Organizational (moving files to correct locations)
- ‚úÖ Cleanup (removing debug code and backups)
- ‚úÖ No changes to Mac code or core functionality

The Mac build should work perfectly. If any issues, they'll be minor import path problems that are easy to fix.
