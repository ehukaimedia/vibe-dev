# Test Failure Analysis - Vibe Dev MVP

## Summary

Out of 26 test files:
- **PASS**: 10 test files
- **FAIL**: 16 test files

## Failing Test Files by Category

### 1. Empty Test Suite Errors (No Jest Tests)
These files are executable scripts with `#!/usr/bin/env node` shebang instead of Jest test files:
- `test/unit/output-isolation.test.ts`
- `test/unit/mcp-tools.test.ts`
- `test/integration/session-persistence.test.ts`
- `test/integration/gh-cli.test.ts`
- `test/integration/for-loop.test.ts` (likely similar)
- `test/integration/isolated-recap.test.ts` (likely similar)

**Root Cause**: These are manual test scripts being picked up by Jest due to the `.test.ts` pattern but don't contain any Jest test definitions.

### 2. Mock/Real Implementation Mismatch
- `test/unit/terminal.test.ts`
  - Expected mocked output "Hello World", received actual shell prompt "$"
  - Expected mocked directory "/mock/directory", received actual "/Users/ehukaimedia/Desktop/AI-Applications/Node/vibe-dev"
  - Command timeout test expects exit code -1, gets 0
  - PTY mock not properly initialized (onExit undefined)

### 3. Output Parsing Issues
- `test/unit/vibe-terminal-coverage.test.ts`
  - Shell type detection failing (expects "powershell" on Mac, gets "zsh")
  - Exit code detection expects 127 for nonexistent command, gets 1
  - Timeout handling expects "Command timed out" message, gets actual command output

### 4. Command Execution Sequencing
- `test/unit/edge-cases.test.ts`
  - Multiple commands getting mixed up in output
  - Special characters test receiving output from previous command
  - Unicode test receiving output from previous command
  - Script execution test receiving output from previous commands

### 5. Timeout Issues
- `test/unit/pty.test.ts`
  - "should persist working directory between commands" - exceeded 10s timeout
  - "should persist environment variables in session" - exceeded 10s timeout
- `test/unit/mcp-protocol.test.ts`
  - Expected error response not received within 5s timeout
- `test/unit/timeout-fix.test.ts`
  - Timeout handling test expects exit code -1, gets 0

### 6. Unknown Status
- `test/unit/index.test.ts` - needs investigation

## Root Causes Analysis

### Primary Issue: Real vs Mock Execution
The tests appear to be executing real terminal commands instead of using mocks. This causes:
1. Unpredictable output (shell prompts, ANSI codes)
2. Race conditions between commands
3. Platform-specific behavior on Mac vs expected Windows behavior
4. Output from multiple commands getting mixed together

### Secondary Issue: Test File Misidentification
Several integration test files are executable scripts rather than Jest tests, causing Jest to fail when trying to run them.

## Prioritized Fix List

### Priority 1: Fix Test File Structure
1. **Move executable scripts** out of test directories or rename them to not match `*.test.ts` pattern
   - Rename: `output-isolation.test.ts` → `output-isolation.script.ts`
   - Rename: `mcp-tools.test.ts` → `mcp-tools.script.ts`
   - Rename: `session-persistence.test.ts` → `session-persistence.script.ts`
   - Rename: `gh-cli.test.ts` → `gh-cli.script.ts`
   - Check and rename similar files in integration directory

### Priority 2: Fix Mock Configuration
2. **Ensure proper mocking** in terminal tests
   - Verify `node-pty` mock is being loaded correctly
   - Check that mock implementations match expected behavior
   - Ensure mocks are reset between tests

### Priority 3: Fix Terminal Output Isolation
3. **Fix command output isolation** in VibeTerminal
   - Ensure each command's output is properly isolated
   - Clean shell prompts and ANSI codes from output
   - Add proper command sequencing to prevent output mixing

### Priority 4: Fix Platform-Specific Tests
4. **Update platform detection** in tests
   - Fix shell type detection to handle Mac properly
   - Update exit code expectations for different platforms
   - Add platform-specific test conditions where needed

### Priority 5: Fix Timeout Handling
5. **Improve timeout behavior**
   - Ensure timeout commands return exit code -1
   - Add proper timeout messages to output
   - Increase test timeouts where necessary for slow operations

## Configuration Issues

The Jest configuration looks correct:
- Uses `ts-jest` with ESM preset
- Has proper module name mapping
- Excludes Windows-specific tests on Mac
- Has 30-second default timeout

## Mock Setup Analysis

The tests are using `jest.unstable_mockModule` for ES modules, but there are issues:

1. **Duplicate Mock Systems**: 
   - Manual mock in `src/__mocks__/node-pty.ts` 
   - Inline mock in test files using `jest.unstable_mockModule`
   - The inline mocks are taking precedence but not implementing the expected behavior

2. **Mock Implementation Mismatch**:
   - The inline mock in `terminal.test.ts` expects specific command outputs
   - But the actual terminal is being instantiated and running real commands
   - The mock PTY callbacks are not properly simulating the expected responses

3. **Console Errors Show Real Execution**:
   - Console shows "Vibe Terminal: Created session... with zsh shell"
   - This indicates real VibeTerminal instances are being created, not mocked ones

## Quick Fix Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Can be done quickly):

1. **Rename non-test files** (5 minutes):
   ```bash
   mv test/unit/output-isolation.test.ts test/unit/output-isolation.script.ts
   mv test/unit/mcp-tools.test.ts test/unit/mcp-tools.script.ts
   mv test/integration/session-persistence.test.ts test/integration/session-persistence.script.ts
   mv test/integration/gh-cli.test.ts test/integration/gh-cli.script.ts
   mv test/integration/for-loop.test.ts test/integration/for-loop.script.ts
   mv test/integration/isolated-recap.test.ts test/integration/isolated-recap.script.ts
   ```

2. **Update jest config to exclude scripts** (2 minutes):
   Add to `testPathIgnorePatterns` in `jest.config.js`:
   ```javascript
   '*.script.ts'
   ```

3. **Fix mock implementation** (15 minutes):
   - Either fix the inline mocks to properly simulate responses
   - OR remove inline mocks and use the `__mocks__` directory approach
   - Ensure mock spawn returns the mock PTY with proper behavior

### Medium-term fixes:

1. **Standardize mock approach**: Choose either `__mocks__` or inline mocks, not both
2. **Add mock verification tests**: Ensure mocks are being used before running actual tests
3. **Separate unit and integration tests**: Unit tests should always use mocks, integration tests can use real implementation
