# Vibe Dev

**🚀 In Production** - A modern MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that revolutionizes terminal operations through true session persistence and intelligent analysis. Two tools that understand your workflow and help you progress naturally.

## What Makes Vibe Dev Different?

**Production Status**: ✅ **Mac Production Ready** | 🔄 **Windows Testing Required**

Vibe Dev isn't just another terminal wrapper - it's a complete reimagining of how AI assistants interact with development environments. By leveraging modern terminal emulation technology, we deliver what others only promise.

### 🎯 Modern Architecture
- **Terminal Emulation Core**: Uses PTY (Pseudo-Terminal) technology for true shell sessions
- **Real-time Intelligence**: Analyzes actual command output as it happens
- **Event-driven Design**: Responds to your workflow, not just your commands
- **Zero Parsing Overhead**: The terminal handles complexity, we focus on intelligence

### 🧩 Truly Intuitive
- **Works Like You Expect**: `cd`, `source`, `export` - everything persists naturally
- **No Learning Curve**: If you know the terminal, you know Vibe Dev
- **Context-Aware Suggestions**: Based on real outcomes, not guessed patterns
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Each command builds on the last

### 🛡️ Unmatched Reliability
- **Persistent Sessions**: Your shell keeps running even if Claude disconnects
- **State Recovery**: Reconnect to exactly where you left off
- **No Ambiguity**: Direct terminal output means no parsing errors
- **Bulletproof Design**: Built on proven terminal emulation standards

## What is Vibe Dev?

**Production Status**: ✅ **Mac Production Ready** | 🔄 **Windows Testing Required**

Vibe Dev is a revolutionary terminal interface that uses modern **terminal emulation** to provide what traditional command executors can't: true persistent shell sessions with complete state preservation. 

### The Technical Revolution

**Traditional Approach** (What others do):
```bash
# Each command spawns a new shell
execute("cd /project")     # Shell 1 exits
execute("npm install")     # Shell 2 starts fresh in wrong directory
execute("git status")      # Shell 3 has no context
```

**Vibe Dev Approach** (What we do):
```bash
# One persistent shell session via PTY (Pseudo-Terminal)
vibe_terminal("cd /project")     # Your shell
vibe_terminal("npm install")     # Same shell, correct directory
vibe_terminal("git status")      # Same shell, full context preserved
```

### Why This Matters

Unlike traditional tools that spawn isolated commands, Vibe Dev:
- **Maintains true session state** - One continuous shell session, just like your terminal
- **Analyzes outcomes, not patterns** - Direct access to stdout, stderr, and exit codes
- **Provides intelligent workflow insights** - Understands cause and effect across commands
- **Recovers from disconnections** - Your shell keeps running, reconnect anytime
- **Delivers modern terminal features** - Color output, progress bars, interactive commands all work naturally

## Key Features

### 🚀 Persistent Terminal Sessions
```bash
# Traditional tools lose context between commands
$ cd /project      # ✓
$ npm install      # ✗ Back in original directory

# Vibe Dev maintains your session
vibe_terminal("cd /project")      # ✓
vibe_terminal("npm install")      # ✓ Still in /project
```

### 🛡️ Disconnect Recovery - Never Lose Your Context
```bash
# Server disconnected? Network dropped? Claude crashed?
# No problem. Vibe Dev remembers everything.
